# API Logic Server

### TL;DR - creates customizable, model-driven database systems - instantly - from your [database](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Sample-Database)

The `ApiLogicServer create-and-run` command creates a _executable, customizable_ project providing:

1. **Automatic Admin App** [(running here on PythonAnywhere)](http://apilogicserver.pythonanywhere.com/admin-app/index.html#/Home)

   * For instant collaboration and Back Office data maintenance
   * Rich functionality: multi-page, multi-table, automatic joins
   * [Explore](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Admin-Tour/) this Admin App, and how to [customize it](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Working-with-the-Admin-App)


2. **API,** with [Swagger](http://localhost:5656/api)

   * For custom app dev, integration
   * Rich functionality: endpoint for each table, with filtering, pagination, related data
   * [Customizable:](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki#customize-the-api-with-expose_servicespy-add-rpcs-services) add your own endpoints


3. **Business Logic,** for backend processing

   * Spreadsheet-like rules for multi-table derivations and constraints
   * Extensible with Python events for email, messages, etc
   * [Explore](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Logic:-Rules-plus-Python) how logic can meaningfully improve [conciseness](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/wiki/by-code) and quality

To create the sample API and app project in a *minute or two --*  start Docker, and execute the following commands (Windows, use Powershell):

```
cd ~/Desktop                       # directory of API Logic Server projects on local host

# Start (install if required) the API Logic Server docker container
docker run -it --name api_logic_server --rm -p 5656:5656 -p 5002:5002 -v ${PWD}:/localhost apilogicserver/api_logic_server

ApiLogicServer create-and-run --project_name=/localhost/ApiLogicProject --db_url=  # Working Software, Now

```

Your system is running - explore the data and api 
[locally](localhost:5656),
or [on this deployed systems](http://apilogicserver.pythonanywhere.com/admin-app/index.html#/Home).

VSCode and PyCharm users can execute within their IDE with [these steps](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Quick-Start).

In addition to Docker, you can [install](#installation) locally, or on the cloud.

You can picture the process as shown in the diagram below; click it for a video tutorial, showing complete project creation, execution, customization and debugging.

The following tutorial is a good way to explore API Logic Server.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

# API Logic Server - Sample Tutorial

After completing the `Create` step below, you can view the readme in the created ApiLogicProject.  It contains the sample tutorial, created from [this database.](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Sample-Database)  

In this tutorial, we will explore:

* **run** - we will first run the Admin App and the JSON:API

* **customize** - we will then explore some customizations already done for the API and logic, and how to debug them

This tutorial presumes you are running in an IDE - VS Code or PyCharm.  Projects are pre-configured for VS Code with `.devcontainer` and `launch configurations,` so these instructions are oriented around VS Code.  You will need to configure container and launch configurations for PyCharm - [see here](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Quick-Start#project-execution) for more information.

The diagram above summarizes the create / run / customize process.  You can watch the tutorial in [this video.](https://youtu.be/-C5O453Q-Mc)


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Run

Created ApiLogicProjects are instantly executable.  Let's explore the Admin App and the API.

### Admin App: Multi-Page, Multi-Table, Automatic Joins
To run the Admin App, follow these steps:

1. Click **Run and Debug**
   * *Note:* these steps are highlighted in the diagram below
2. Select the `ApiLogicServer` Launch Configuration
3. Press the green run button to start the server
   * If you are running Docker / VS Code, and VS Code will suggest opening a Browser (the _preview_ browser is shown below).  Do so, and you should see the Home screen in your Browser.
   * Otherwise, you can:
      * Open a browser at [localhost:5656](localhost:5656), or
      * Click __View > Command Palette__, select __Simple Browser__, and specify the same url
         * Note: be aware that we have seen some issue where the _simple browser_ fails to start; just use your normal browser  
4. Explore the app: multi-page, multi-table, automatic joins
   * Navigate to `Customer`
     * Depending on your screen size, you may need to hit the "hamburger menu" (top left) to see the left menu
   * Click the Customer row  to see Customer Details
   * Observe the `Placed Order List` tab at the bottom
   * Click the first Order row
   * Click the `Order Detail List` tab at the bottom
   * Click the first __Product Id__ to see its detail information
6. (Close the app (browser), but leave the server running)

<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/blob/main/images/ui-admin/run-admin-app.png?raw=true"></figure>

&nbsp;&nbsp;

  > **Key Take-away:** instant multi-page / multi-table admin apps, suitable for **back office, and instant agile collaboration.**

&nbsp;

### JSON:API - Related Data, Filtering, Sorting, Pagination, Swagger
Your API is instantly ready to support ui and integration
development, available in swagger, as shown below.  JSON:APIs are interesting because they
are client configurable to **reduce network traffic** and **minimize organizational dependencies.**

The creation process builds not only the API, but swagger so you can explore it.  The Admin App Home page provides a link to the swagger, but it doesn't work in VS Code's simple browser.  So, we'll launch a new Simple Browser, like this:
1. Click __View > Command__ to open the Command Palette
   * Enter command: `Simple Browser: Show`
   * Specify the URL: `http://localhost:5656/api`
2. Explore the swagger
   * Note: you can drag windows to arrange your viewing area
3. (Leave the swagger and server running)

<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/blob/main/images/ui-admin/swagger.png?raw=true"></figure>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  > **Key Take-away:** instant *rich* APIs, with filtering, sorting, pagination and swagger.  **Custom App Dev is unblocked.**


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Customize and Debug

That's quite a good start on a project.  But we've all seen generators that get close, but fail because the results cannot be extended, debugged, or managed with tools such as git and diff.

Let's examine how API Logic Server projects can be customized for both APIs and logic.  We'll first have a quick look at the created project structure, then some typical customizations.

> The API and admin app you just reviewed above were ***not*** customized - they were created completely from the database structure.  For the sample project, we've injected some API and logic customizations, so you can explore them in this tutorial, as described below.


### Project Structure
Use VS Code's **Project Explorer** to see the project structure:

| Directory | Usage                         | Key Customization File             | Typical Customization                                                                 |
|:-------------- |:------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```api``` | JSON:API                      | ```api/customize_api.py```         | Add new end points / services                                                         |
| ```database``` | SQLAlchemy Data Model Classes | ```database/customize_models.py``` | Add derived attributes, and relationships missing in the schema                       |
| ```logic``` | Transactional Logic           | ```logic/declare_logic.py```       | Declare multi-table derivations, constraints, and events such as send mail / messages |
| ```ui``` | Admin App                     | ```ui/admin/admin.yaml```          | Control field display, ordering, etc.                                                 |

<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/main/images/generated-project.png"></figure>

Let's now explore some examples.

### Admin App Customization
There is no code for the Admin app - it's behavior is declared in the `admin.yaml` model file.  Alter this file to control labels, hide fields, change display order, etc:

1. Open **Explorer > ui/admin/admin.yaml**
   * Find and alter the string `- label: 'Placed Order List*'` (e.g, make it plural)
   * Click Save
2. Launch the app: [http://localhost:5656](http://localhost:5656)
3. Load the updated configuration: click __Configuration > Reset__
4. Revisit **Customer > Order** to observe the new label

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  > **Key Take-away:** you can alter labels, which fields are displayed and their order, etc -- via a simple model.  No need to learn a new framework, or deal with low-level code or html.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


### API Customization

While a standards-based API is a great start, sometimes you need custom endpoints tailored exactly to your business requirement.  You can create these as shown below, where we create an additional endpoint for `add_order`.

To review the implementation: 

1. Open **Explorer > api/customize_api.py**:
3. Set the breakpoint as shown
4. Use the swagger to access the `ServicesEndPoint > add_order`, and
   1. **Try it out**, then 
   2. **execute**
5. Your breakpoint will be hit
   1. You can examine the variables, step, etc.
6. Click **Continue** on the floating debug menu (upper right in screen shot below)

<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/raw/main/images/docker/VSCode/nw-readme/customize-api.png"></figure>


### Logic
We've all seen excellent technology that can create great User Interfaces. But for transactional systems, their approach to logic is basically "your code goes here".

> That's a problem - for transaction systems, the backend constraint and derivation logic is often nearly *half* the system.
 
The *logic* portion of API *Logic* server is a declarative approach - you declare spreadsheet-like rules for multi-table constraints and derivations.  The 5 rules shown below represent the same logic as 200 lines of Python - a remarkable **40X.**

> Since they automate all the re-use and dependency management, rules are [40X more concise](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/wiki/by-code) than code.

[Logic](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Logic:-Rules-plus-Python) consists of rules **and** conventional Python code.  Explore it like this:
1. Open **Explorer > logic/declare_logic.py**:
   * Observe the 5 rules highlighted in the diagram below.  These are built with code completion.
2. Set a breakpoint as shown
   * This event illustrates that logic is mainly _rules,_ extensible with standard _Python code_
3. Using swagger, re-execute the `add_order` endpoint
4. When you hit the breakpoint, expand `row` VARIABLES list (top left)

<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/raw/main/images/docker/VSCode/nw-readme/declare-logic.png"></figure>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Wrap up
Let's recap what you've seen:

* **ApiLogicProject Creation and Execution** - a database API and an Admin App - created automatically from a database, in moments instead of weeks or months


* **Customizable** - the UI, API and Logic - using Visual Studio code, for both editing and debugging

### Docker cleanup
VS Code leaves the container and image definitions intact, so you can quickly resume your session.  You may wish to delete this. it will look something like `vsc-ApiLogicProject...`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Project Operations

# Command Language Details


<details>
  <summary>Click to see Docker run argument descriptions, and how to inspect Docker environment</summary>

### Install - `docker run`
Once you've [installed Docker](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Working-with-Docker) itself, the `docker run` command above installs the ApiLogicServer docker (if it's not already there), and starts it, opening a terminal window on the Docker container.  Notes:
* the `v ${PWD}:/localhost` argument is what enables the ApiLogicServer to create / access the project on your local host
   * Windows - Powershell must be used (due to the `$(PWD)` syntax)
   * if you use Command Prompt, specify the local directory completely 
   
The **arguments** mean:
* **-it** - launch a terminal window for the Docker container
* **--name api_logic_server** - the name of the image on your local host
* **-rm** - remove the container once it stops (your project files are not lost - they are on your local host)
* **-p 5656:5656** - maps local (host) part to Docker port 
* **-v ${PWD}:/localhost** - maps a local directory to a mount name for Docker.  This is where a directory will be created for your new project.  
   * `${PWD}` is your current folder.  
      * You could also provide a specific folder, e.g., `~/dev/servers` (Unix), or `C:\Users\val\dev\servers` (windows)
   * `/localhost`is the mounted volume reference from inside the Docker container
* **`apilogicserver/api_logic_server`** - the name of the image to pull from Docker Hub.  
   * This will fetch the image first time, and will run it locally on subsequent runs
   * The image is not automatically refreshed -- install ApiLogicServer updates as described below

You may also wish to add a parameter for networking:
* **--net my-network** - attaches to my-network

On your Docker container, you can **inspect** your environment:
```
python py.py
```

Open a new terminal window on your **local host**, and find your docker IP address:

```
docker inspect api_logic_server  # you will find the ip, e.g., 172.17.0.2
```

</details>
    

# Internals - How It Works
Please see [Architecture - How It Works](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Architecture#internals---how-it-works).

# Installation
As of release 3.00.00, you can install using Docker (recommended), standard
`pip` install, or PytonAnywhere.

## Installation Options

#### Docker Installation
[Docker installation](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Install-Guide#docker-install)
enables you to bypass sometimes-tricky Python installs by using Docker.

Docker support provides not only ApiLogicServer, but a Python environment
you can use with your IDE.  It is described above.

See the link above for more information on install and execution.

#### Local Installation
Caution: Python install is rather more than running an installer.
Use this page to [Verify / Install Python](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Install-Guide).

Then, install the ApiLogicServer CLI in the usual manner:

```
python3 -m venv venv       # may require python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # windows venv\Scripts\activate
pip install ApiLogicServer # you may need to use pip3, or restart your terminal session
```


#### Cloud Install - Pythonanwhere
API Logic Server runs well on [pythonanywhere](http://pythonanywhere.com/).  See [these instructions](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Install-Guide#pythonanywhere).

Here is the [sample on PythonAnywhere.](http://apilogicserver.pythonanywhere.com/admin-app/index.html)

## Quick Start

Once installed, use the [Quick Start](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Quick-Start) to create and load the sample project.


## Installation Notes

### Heads up - Certificate Issues
We sometimes see Python / Flask AppBuilder Certificate issues - see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Troubleshooting#certificate-failures).

### Default Python version
In some cases, your computer may have multiple Python versions, such as ```python3```.  ```ApiLogicServer run``` relies on the default Python being 3.8 or higher.  You can resolve this by:
* making ```python3``` the default Python, or
* using ```ApiLogicServer create```, and running ```python3 api_logic_server_run.py```


# Project Information

### Tutorials
There are a number of facilities that will quickly enable you to get familiar with API Logic Server:
* [Tutorial](#api-logic-server---sample-tutorial) walks you through the steps of creating a server
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVTdu6c0iSI) shows the steps of creating a server


### Status

We have tested several databases - see [status here.](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Testing)

We are tracking [issues in git](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/issues).

We have introduced several renames to clarify operation.
These do not affect existing projects.  However, we've not updated all the docs to reflect these changes:
* `logic/declare_logic.py` replaces `logic_bank.py`
* `api/customize_api.py` replaces `expose_services.py`
* `database/customize_models.py` replaces `models_ext.py`
